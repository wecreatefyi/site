We are The Oshkosh Hack Club, also known as We Create, fiscally sponsored by _The Hack Foundation._
 
**Established in 2024, we set out on a mission** to solve a problem in our community; The lack of computer literacy. We wish to empowering young engineers in the Oshkosh area to use computers to plan, make, and ship personal projects by helping them learn about computers, software, and hardware.

Partnered with the _Oshkosh Public Library_, we offer free and public meetings every other week to elementary, middle, and high schoolers in the area. We hope to inspire these students to learn more about engineering and computing through hands-on projects, giving them the crucial real-world experience required to succeed and excel in computer science.

Our first meeting is Saturday, September 7th, and subsequent meetings take place every other saturday.

#### More information is coming soon. We hope to see you at a meeting!
