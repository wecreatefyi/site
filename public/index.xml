      <description>We are The Oshkosh Hack Club, also known as WeCreate, fiscally sponsored by The Hack Foundation.&#xA;Established in 2024, we set out on a mission to solve a problem in our community; The lack of interest in computer science. We wish to empower young engineers in the Oshkosh area to use computers to plan, make, and ship personal projects by helping them learn about computers, software, and hardware.&#xA;Partnered with the Oshkosh Public Library, we will be holding free and public meetings every other week open to all students up to 12th grade.</description>
