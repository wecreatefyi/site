      <description>We are The Oshkosh Hack Club, also known as We Create, fiscally sponsored by The Hack Foundation.&#xA;Established in 2024, we set out on a mission to solve a problem in our community; The lack of computer literacy. We wish to empowering young engineers in the Oshkosh area to use computers to plan, make, and ship personal projects by helping them learn about computers, software, and hardware.&#xA;Partnered with the Oshkosh Public Library, we offer free and public meetings every other week to elementary, middle, and high schoolers in the area.</description>
